## ✨ Highlights

</div>

- 🔍 **Smart scan** — recursively walks folders, cleans messy release names, and matches them against TMDb
- 🖼️ **Posters & metadata** — automatic thumbnail downloads, ratings, genres, cast, runtime
- 📦 **Single binary** — one statically-linked Go executable, no runtime, no dependencies
- 🗂️ **SQLite (WAL)** — fast, durable, zero-config local database in `./data/movie.db`
- ↩️ **Undo / redo** — every move, rename, scan, and delete is reversible
- 🌐 **REST API + web UI** — `movie rest --open` launches a local dashboard
- 🛠️ **Self-updating** — `movie update` pulls, rebuilds, and hands off in-place
- 🔒 **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, macOS on `amd64` and `arm64`

## Quick Start

</div>

### Install latest release

Picks up whatever is currently tagged `latest` on GitHub — and if no release has been published yet, automatically falls back to a source-build from `main` so you still end up with a working binary.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/main/get.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/main/get.sh | bash
```

> The bootstrap probes `releases/latest/download/install.{ps1,sh}` first. If a release exists, it installs the pre-built binary. If not, it transparently falls back to cloning and building from `main` — and prints exactly which path it took. See [Installation](#installation) for flags and details.

### Install a specific version (pinned)

Installs exactly the version in the URL — never auto-upgrades. Use this for CI pipelines, Dockerfiles, reproducible setups, or when you need to roll back. Replace `v2.130.0` with the [release tag](https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases) you want.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases/download/v2.130.0/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases/download/v2.130.0/install.sh | bash
```

> **Which one should I use?** Use **latest** for personal machines so you stay current. Use **pinned** anywhere reproducibility matters — the pinned script is hard-locked to the version in the URL and will install that exact tag forever, even after newer releases ship. ([contract spec](spec/12-ci-cd-pipeline/06-version-pinned-install-scripts.md))

### Set up & scan

```bash
movie config set tmdb_api_key YOUR_KEY
movie scan ~/Downloads
movie ls
```

### Search & discover

```bash
movie search "Inception"
movie suggest 5
```

Every command supports `--help` or `-h` for detailed usage.

## Installation

</div>

### One-Liner Install (recommended)

Two flavours — pick based on whether you want auto-updates or a frozen version.

#### Latest release (auto-tracks newest)

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/main/get.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux / macOS (Bash)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/main/get.sh | bash
```

`get.{ps1,sh}` first checks `releases/latest/download/install.{ps1,sh}`. If a release is published it installs the pre-built binary; otherwise it falls back to a source-build from `main`, prints exactly which path it took, and tells the maintainer how to publish a release so future installs skip the build step.

#### Pinned to a specific release

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases/download/v2.130.0/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux / macOS (Bash)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases/download/v2.130.0/install.sh | bash
```

The script attached to each release has the version baked in (`PINNED_VERSION="v2.130.0"`) and will install **exactly** that tag — it never falls back to "latest" and never delegates to the bootstrap scripts. Replace `v2.130.0` with any [published release](https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6/releases).

> **When to use which**
> - **Latest** — personal machines, demos, "just give me the newest one"
> - **Pinned** — CI pipelines, Dockerfiles, onboarding docs, reproducing a bug on a specific version, controlled rollbacks
>
> Both URLs point at installer assets attached to the GitHub Release. The repo-root `install.ps1` and `install.sh` are unrelated source bootstrap scripts for building locally.

### Installer Options

**Windows (PowerShell):**

| Flag | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `-InstallDir` | Custom install directory | `-InstallDir C:\tools\movie` |
| `-Arch` | Force architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`) | `-Arch arm64` |
| `-NoPath` | Skip adding to user PATH | `-NoPath` |

**Linux / macOS (Bash):**

| Flag | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | Custom install directory | `--dir ~/bin` |
| `--arch` | Force architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`) | `--arch arm64` |
| `--no-path` | Skip adding to PATH | `--no-path` |

### Clone & Build (Development)

**Prerequisites:**

| Requirement | Minimum | Check |
|---|---|---|
| **Go** | 1.22+ | `go version` |
| **Git** | 2.x | `git --version` |
| **PowerShell** | 5.1+ (Win) / 7+ (Unix) | `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/movie-cli-v6.git
cd movie-cli-v6
pwsh run.ps1
```

**Using the bootstrap installer:**

```powershell
pwsh install.ps1                      # Fresh install (clone + build + deploy)
pwsh install.ps1 -DeployPath ~/bin    # Custom deploy path
```

### Verify

```bash
movie version
# v1.0.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-04-09)
#   Go:   go1.22.0
#   OS:   linux/amd64
```

> **Tip:** If `movie` is not found, add the deploy path to your `PATH`.
> Default: `E:\bin-run` (Windows) or `/usr/local/bin` (Unix) for source builds.

## What It Does

</div>

A portable CLI that manages your personal movie and TV show library entirely from the terminal. Every scan produces:

- **Database** — structured metadata in SQLite (WAL mode)
- **Thumbnails** — poster images downloaded from TMDb
- **JSON** — per-file metadata written to `./data/json/`
- **Clean filenames** — `Scream.2022.1080p.WEBRip.x264.mkv` → `Scream (2022).mkv`

All data lives in `./data/` at the project root.

## Command Reference

</div>

Each section below shows a real-world example of what the command does.
Each thumbnail is a short looping walkthrough — hover or click to view the full-size still.

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>PowerShell vs Bash quick reference</strong> — escaping paths & passing env vars in the examples below</summary>

The example commands are written in **Bash** (macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash). On **Windows PowerShell** a few things differ — use this table to translate any example before running it:

| Concept | Bash (macOS / Linux / WSL) | PowerShell (Windows) |
|---|---|---|
| Home folder | `~/Downloads` | `$HOME\Downloads` or `$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads` |
| Path with spaces | `"My Movies/Action Films"` (double quotes) | `'My Movies\Action Films'` (single quotes — no variable expansion) |
| Path separator | `/` | `\` (PowerShell also accepts `/`) |
| Escape a literal quote | `\"` inside `"..."` | `` ` " `` (backtick + quote) or use `'...'` |
| Read an env var | `$TMDB_KEY` | `$env:TMDB_KEY` |
| Set env var (one command) | `TMDB_KEY=abc movie scan ~/Downloads` | `$env:TMDB_KEY="abc"; movie scan $HOME\Downloads` |
| Set env var (whole session) | `export TMDB_KEY=abc` | `$env:TMDB_KEY = "abc"` |
| Set env var (persistent) | add `export ...` to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` | `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("TMDB_KEY","abc","User")` |
| Command substitution | `cd $(movie cd Movies)` | `Set-Location (movie cd Movies)` |
| Line continuation | trailing `\` | trailing `` ` `` (backtick) |
| Comments | `# comment` | `# comment` (same) |

**Rule of thumb:** if an example uses `~`, `$VAR`, `\"`, or `$(...)`, swap it for the PowerShell equivalent above. Everything else (flags, subcommands, IDs) is identical across shells.

  <em>📸 <code>movie stats</code> renders an instant overview — counts, storage used, top genres, and average rating.</em>
</p>

**▶ Try the example from the screenshot** — view stats, then prune any stale entries it surfaces:

```bash
# 1. Reproduce the walkthrough's library overview + top-genres chart
movie stats

# 2. Dry-run a cleanup to see entries whose files no longer exist
movie cleanup

# 3. Actually remove them once you're happy with the dry-run output
movie cleanup --remove
```

> **No placeholders here** — `movie stats` and `movie cleanup` run as-is.

## Troubleshooting

</div>

The most common errors users hit, what each one means, and the exact command to fix it. Each entry links back to the matching walkthrough in the [Command Reference](#command-reference).

### 1. `tmdb_api_key not set` — TMDb requests are skipped

**Symptom:** `movie scan` runs but every file is reported as `! no TMDb match — saved as Unknown` (see the warning row in the [scan walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-scan-library.gif)).

**Cause:** No TMDb API key configured. The scanner falls back to filename-only parsing.

**Fix:**

```bash
movie config set tmdb_api_key YOUR_KEY      # see assets/screenshots/cmd-config-system.gif
movie config                                 # confirm: tmdb_api_key = ********  (set)
movie rescan                                 # backfill metadata for previously-unmatched entries
```

If the key is set but matches still fail, see error #5 (rate limits).

---

### 2. `no TMDb match` for a known title

**Symptom:** A file you recognize ends up unmatched in the [scan walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-scan-library.gif), tagged `⚠ no TMDb match`.

**Cause:** The release filename is too noisy for the cleaner (extra release-group tags, unusual separators, foreign titles).

**Fix:** Search and link manually.

```bash
movie search "The Matrix"           # live TMDb search
movie info "The Matrix"             # confirm the right title
movie rescan                        # re-resolve everything still missing metadata
```

If the title genuinely isn't in TMDb, the OMDb fallback kicks in automatically when `OMDB_API_KEY` is set (see error #6).

---

### 3. `move` refuses to run — destination directory missing

**Symptom:** `movie move` aborts before showing the planned destinations from the [file-management walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-file-management.gif), printing `movies_dir does not exist` or `tv_dir does not exist`.

**Cause:** `movies_dir` / `tv_dir` point to a folder that hasn't been created yet.

**Fix:**

```bash
movie config                                 # check current paths
mkdir -p ~/Movies ~/TVShows                  # create the destinations
movie config set movies_dir ~/Movies         # or repoint to an existing folder
movie config set tv_dir ~/TVShows
```

---

### 4. Wrong files moved — need to roll back

**Symptom:** A `movie move --all` or `movie rename` batch put files in unexpected places.

**Fix:** Every operation is tracked. Use the flow shown in the [history & undo walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-history-undo.gif):

```bash
movie undo --list                # find the batch ID (e.g. 42)
movie undo --id 42               # revert exactly that batch
# changed your mind?
movie redo                       # re-apply the last undone operation
```

`movie undo` always works in reverse chronological order — there is no "permanent" move.

---

### 5. `TMDb 429 Too Many Requests` — rate limited

**Symptom:** `movie scan` or `movie suggest` (see the [discovery walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-discovery.gif)) prints `tmdb: 429 too many requests` and skips entries.

**Cause:** TMDb caps free keys at ~50 requests / second. Large scans can briefly exceed it.

**Fix:** The scanner backs off automatically; just re-run the resolver after a short pause:

```bash
sleep 5 && movie rescan          # backfill anything skipped
movie logs                       # inspect any retained warnings
```

---

### 6. `OMDB_API_KEY not set` — fallback tier silently disabled

**Symptom:** Some titles still show as `Unknown` even after `movie rescan`, and `movie logs` shows `omdb: tier skipped (no key)`.

**Cause:** OMDb is the secondary provider used when TMDb has no result. It's opt-in and reads only from the environment — never the config file or repo.

**Fix:**

```bash
export OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_key            # add to your shell profile to persist
movie rescan
movie logs                                   # confirm the omdb-skip warnings are gone
```

If you also see `omdb: 401 unauthorized`, the key is wrong — generate a new one at omdbapi.com.

---

### 7. Stale entries — files were moved/deleted outside the CLI

**Symptom:** `movie ls` shows entries whose files no longer exist on disk. `movie stats` (see the [maintenance walkthrough](assets/screenshots/cmd-maintenance.gif)) over-reports `Total size`.

**Fix:**

```bash
movie cleanup                    # dry-run: list stale entries
movie cleanup --remove           # actually delete them from the DB
movie duplicates                 # also surface accidental dupes after a cleanup
```

---

### 8. `database is locked` — second `movie` process running

**Symptom:** Any command exits with `database is locked` or `SQLITE_BUSY`.

**Cause:** SQLite WAL allows many readers but only one writer at a time. A long-running `movie rest` server or a hung `movie scan` can hold the write lock.

**Fix:**

```bash
movie db                         # confirms the path of the locked DB
# stop any running 'movie rest' / 'movie scan'
ps -ef | grep -i movie           # find lingering processes
kill <pid>
```

If the lock persists after killing all processes, delete `data/movie.db-wal` and `data/movie.db-shm` (the live DB file is safe to keep).

---

### 9. `command not found: movie` after `movie update`

**Symptom:** Self-update appears to succeed but the next invocation prints `command not found`.

**Cause:** The new binary was deployed to a directory not on `$PATH`, or shell hash cache is stale.

**Fix:**

```bash
movie update-cleanup             # remove any half-installed temp binaries
hash -r                          # bash/zsh: clear the command cache
which movie                      # verify the resolved path
movie version                    # confirm the new build (see assets/screenshots/cmd-config-system.gif)
```

On Windows, restart the terminal so the updated `PATH` is picked up.

---

### Still stuck?

1. Run `movie version` and include the output in any bug report — it pins down the exact commit and build date.
2. Run `movie logs` — the most recent error rows usually point straight at the failing layer (TMDb / DB / filesystem).
3. Open an issue with the `version` line, the failing command, and the relevant `logs` excerpt.

## Release Workflow

</div>

Releases are fully automated via GitHub Actions. Pushing to a `release/**` branch or a `v*` tag triggers:

1. **Cross-compilation** — 6 binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS × amd64/arm64)
2. **Packaging** — `.zip` (Windows) and `.tar.gz` (Unix)
3. **SHA256 checksums** — `checksums.txt` with all artifact hashes
4. **Install scripts** — version-pinned `install.ps1` and `install.sh`
5. **GitHub Release** — formatted page with changelog, checksums, and install instructions

### Creating a Release

```bash
# Option A: Push a release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0
git push origin release/v1.3.0

# Option B: Tag directly
git tag v1.3.0
git push origin v1.3.0
```

Both trigger the same pipeline. Version is resolved from the ref name.

> **CI Pipeline:** Pushing a `release/*` branch or `v*` tag triggers GitHub Actions to cross-compile 6 targets, generate checksums, and create a GitHub release with changelog and install instructions.

See [spec/12-ci-cd-pipeline/02-release-pipeline.md](spec/12-ci-cd-pipeline/02-release-pipeline.md) for the full pipeline spec.

## Milestones

</div>

Project milestones are tracked in [`MILESTONES.md`](MILESTONES.md) at the repository root.

- **Location** — `MILESTONES.md` (repo root, version-controlled)
- **Timezone** — Malaysia time (UTC+8, `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`)
- **Timestamp format** — `dd-MMM-YYYY hh:mm AM/PM` (e.g. `24-Apr-2026 03:33 PM`)
- **Entry format** — one bullet per line under the `## Log` heading:

  ```
  - <event> <dd-MMM-YYYY hh:mm AM/PM> — <short note>
  ```

Example entries:

```
- let's start now 24-Apr-2026 03:33 PM — milestone tracker initialized
- run 24-Apr-2026 07:21 PM — app run logged
```

New entries are appended to the end of the `## Log` section. Generate the timestamp with:

```bash

### Listing & filtering milestones

The `movie milestones` command reads `MILESTONES.md` and prints entries with
optional date / keyword filters:

```bash
movie milestones                              # show all entries
movie milestones --keyword scan               # case-insensitive substring
movie milestones --date 2026-04-24            # only entries on this day
movie milestones --since 2026-04-01           # entries on/after this day
movie milestones --since 2026-04-01 -k run -n 20
```

Flags: `--date YYYY-MM-DD`, `--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `-k/--keyword TEXT`,
`-n/--limit N` (0 = no cap).

### One-shot helper (append + version bump + commit)

The repo ships with a script that appends a new milestone, bumps the **patch**
version in `version/info.go`, and creates a single git commit covering both
changes:

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
scripts/log-milestone.sh                       # default: "- run <ts> — app run logged"
scripts/log-milestone.sh "kickoff complete"    # custom note
scripts/log-milestone.sh --event start "kickoff"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
pwsh scripts/log-milestone.ps1
pwsh scripts/log-milestone.ps1 -Note "kickoff complete"
pwsh scripts/log-milestone.ps1 -Event start -Note "kickoff"
```

Wire it into the app (e.g. at the end of `movie` startup, or as a `make run`
target) to get a milestone + commit on every run. Commit message format:
`chore(milestone): <event> <timestamp> — <note> (<new-version>)`.
